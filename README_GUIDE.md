# Step-by-Step Guide

## Step 1: Project Planning

### Define Objectives:
- Create a detailed specification document outlining the wallet’s features and functionalities.

### Gather Requirements:
- Identify user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to mint tokens easily").
- Define technical requirements (e.g., supported blockchains).

### Research Existing Solutions:
- Analyze existing wallets like MetaMask for feature sets and user experience.

---

## Step 2: Technology Stack Selection

### Frontend:
- **Web:** React.js
- **Mobile:** React Native (for both iOS and Android)

### Backend:
- **Server:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL

### Blockchain Interaction:
- Web3.js or Ethers.js for Ethereum and EVM networks.
- SDKs for SONALA, Bitcoin, and TRON.

---

## Step 3: Design Phase

### UI/UX Design:
- Use tools like Figma to create wireframes and prototypes.
- Ensure the design is intuitive and supports multiple languages.

### Architecture Design:
- Design the system architecture, including:
  - Frontend components
  - Backend services
  - Blockchain interactions

---

## Step 4: Development Phase

### Set Up the Development Environment:
- Install necessary tools (Node.js, MongoDB, React).
- Set up version control (Git).

### Smart Contract Development:
- Write smart contracts for token minting and bridging using Solidity.

#### Example contract structure:
solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Token {
    string public name = "Sample Token";
    string public symbol = "STK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    // Mint function
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
    }
}
- Deploy contracts on testnets (e.g., Rinkeby) for testing.

### Frontend Development:
- Create components for wallet functionalities:
  - Wallet creation and management
  - Token minting interface
  - Bridging interface
- Use Web3.js to connect the frontend to the blockchain.

### Backend Development:
- Set up RESTful APIs for wallet functionalities, user management, and transaction processing.

#### Example API endpoint for minting tokens:
javascript
app.post('/api/mint', async (req, res) => {
    const { address, amount } = req.body;
    // Call smart contract mint function
});
### Payment Gateway Integration:
- Research and integrate APIs from payment gateways like Stripe or Coinbase Commerce for fiat transactions.

---

## Step 5: Testing Phase

### Unit Testing:
- Write unit tests for smart contracts using frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat.

### Integration Testing:
- Test the integration of frontend, backend, and blockchain components.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
- Gather feedback from real users and make necessary adjustments.

### Security Testing:
- Conduct security audits and penetration testing on smart contracts and the application.

---

## Step 6: Deployment Phase

### Deploy Smart Contracts:
- Deploy the audited smart contracts to the mainnet.

### Deploy Backend and Frontend:
- Host the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- Deploy the frontend on services like Vercel or Netlify.

### Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Implement monitoring tools to track performance and security.

---

## Step 7: User Education and Support

### Documentation:
- Create user manuals and technical documentation for developers.

### Customer Support:
- Set up a support system (e.g., chat support, ticketing system).

---

## Step 8: Post-Launch Activities

### Feedback Collection:
- Use surveys or feedback forms to gather user opinions.

### Feature Enhancements:
- Plan for future updates based on user needs and market trends.
